            Orewa Beach is a beautiful, family-friendly beach located just north of Auckland, New Zealand.
            It stretches for about 3 kilometers, offering soft golden sand, 
            safe swimming, and plenty of space for walking, jogging, or relaxing. 
            Popular with both locals and tourists, Orewa is also great for paddleboarding, 
            surfing, and kite flying. The nearby town center has cafes, restaurants and shops,
             making it a perfect day-trip destination from Auckland.</p>
